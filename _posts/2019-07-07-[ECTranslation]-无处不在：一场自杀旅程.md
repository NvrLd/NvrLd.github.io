Everywhere and Nowhere: A Journey through Suicide**

*I did not want to die, only felt that I would, or should, or must, and I had my pain and my reasons.*

By Donald Antrim

*I was not on the roof to jump. I was not there to kill myself. I was there to die, but dying was not a plan. I was not making decisions, choices, threats, or mistakes. I was, I think—looking back now—in acceptance.*

One Friday in April, 2006, I spent the afternoon and evening pacing the roof of my apartment building in Brooklyn, climbing down the fire-escape ladder and hanging by my hands from the railing, then climbing back up with sore palms and lying on the roof, in a ball, or stretched out on my back or on my stomach, peering surreptitiously over the ledge. The roof is painted silver. The building is four stories tall. A group of my friends, each of whom had been on the phone with me, one after the other, all through the morning, when I’d been alone and dialling wildly, had got busy calling one another. Janice owned a car, and she and Nicky were coming across the bridge from Manhattan, but there was traffic, and no one knew where I was.

From the roof, the world seemed to scream. I heard sirens—police, ambulance, and fire. What agency would come for me? A helicopter was flying overhead and circling back. The woman I’d just run from, the woman who had rushed over from work ahead of the others, who had been with me downstairs in my apartment, Regan, my partner then, my caregiver, thought that I’d gone to the street. We had been fighting over something I’d done. I’d hurt her, and we were both in anguish. She spoke harshly, and I ran away to die and end her burden. 

The sun was setting, and the sky over New Jersey was orange, and I was in my socks, shivering. I was afraid, not anxious or scared but afraid for my life. I didn’t know why I had to fall from the roof, why that was mine to do.

Or, rather, I did know. I was in psychosis, a fatal emergent illness, and I knew what the suicide knows. I knew that I would die. I felt that I had been dying all my life.

When telling the story of my illness, I try not to speak about depression. A depression is a furrow, a valley, a sloping downward, and a return. Suicide, in my experience, is not that. I believe that suicide is a natural history, a disease process, not an act or a choice, a decision or a wish. I do not understand suicide as a response to pain, or as a message to the living. I do not think of suicide as the act, the death, the fall from a height or the trigger pulled. I see it as a long illness, an illness with origins in trauma and isolation, in deprivation of touch, in violence and neglect, in the loss of home and belonging. It is a disease of the body and the brain, if you make that distinction, a disease that kills over time. My dying, my suicide, lasted years, through hospitalizations, through more than fifty rounds of electroconvulsive therapy—once known as shock therapy—through recovery, relapse, and recovery. It can seem recent in memory, though at times it feels ancient, far removed, another lifetime, another life and my life.

I was hanging from the fire escape. I kept a slight toehold. The sun was low; the air was cold. I was wearing socks but no shoes, and my palms were scraped and beginning to blister from letting go a little, one hand at a time, falling out at an angle, sideways or backward, then grabbing fast for the rail and clutching tight. I gazed down at the concrete patio and the chain-link fence surrounding the back yard. The yard was inaccessible, small, and neglected. My apartment is on the third floor, and windows in my kitchen and bedroom overlook it, though you’d have to stick your head out to see much. I’d never looked at the yard for more than a minute.

Below me was the small patio area littered with trash, and a stairwell leading to the locked basement and the boiler. The rest was hard ground. Since that time, since 2006, new people, a family, have moved into the first-floor apartment, and they’ve replaced the old chain-link fence with one made of wood and put in a barbecue and a picnic table; I can hear their children when it’s warm out, along with, on school days, even in the cold winter months, older children, neighborhood kids, playing and screaming on the rooftop playground of the private school a few doors down the street.

Recess was over; school was out; night was falling. I had no children. I held on to the railing. It was less dizzying to look down than up. Clouds crossed the sky. Here and there, I could see people having after-work cocktails on private decks on neighboring roofs—it was the beginning of a spring weekend. Now, remembering that day, I wonder what those people might have thought of the man scrambling from fire escape to rooftop and back, letting go with one hand, flopping down on his belly to crane over the edge. Did they imagine that he was doing work, maintenance or repair, some job they couldn’t clearly make out? If they had known the man’s troubles, had known the man, would they have understood that he was about to die? Or would they have imagined that he was trying to live?

It was getting darker, and I could hear traffic on the street below, people driving home through Brooklyn after work. I was cold; I’d been up there a long time. I didn’t know that it had been five hours. It could have been any amount of time. I had on pants, a shirt, and socks. My hands and clothes were dirty from the rooftop. I remember how loosely my pants fit, how thin I’d become over the winter. Where was my belt? I shoved my hands into my pockets and squeezed my arms against my sides, holding up my pants, trying to get warm.

I’d written about my mother, her alcoholic life and her resignation in death, and my role as her son, savior, and abandoner. I began writing the year after she died, too soon for writing to be safe. The book, “The Afterlife”, is divided into seven parts, the number of years, in classical myth and literature, that is considered an appropriate period of mourning, and the number of years it took me to complete the manuscript. It is an accounting of the death of my family. Writing the book had been an excitement, but publishing it was an ordeal. I didn’t know that the book wasn’t about me, that it was about something shared between writer and reader. It was a movement from exposition to scene, defense to acceptance, mortification to love. But my old worlds—Florida, Virginia, the places of my childhood—were costly to rebuild. I was engaged in betrayal: mine of my mother, hers of me, mine of myself.

When I was in my early twenties, out of college and living in New York, on East Eighty-fifth Street, I returned again and again to Miami to rescue my mother. My father had left her and precipitously remarried, and she was drinking herself to death.

One night, back in New York, back behind the lines, as we say, I was with friends at the Madison Pub, a dark old bar on Madison Avenue in the Seventies, up from the old Whitney Museum. The panelled walls were scarred with the carved signatures of literary men—Walter Winchell’s was the biggest. I was drinking a Manhattan. There was a pay phone at the back of the bar; I left my drink on the table, went to the phone, picked it up, called my mother, and listened to fifteen rings, twenty rings, twenty-five. There was a sound, someone picked up, but there was no voice. “Mom, Mom, Mom,” I said, and then hung up the phone, picked it back up, and dialled my grandfather, my mother’s father, in North Carolina. He worried over his daughter all the time. I told him that she was in trouble. I told him that I had to go to Florida. I stopped at the table and told my friends that I had to go, and then walked uptown to my apartment, where I packed, checked the stove, turned off the lights, locked the door behind me, and hurried down the stairs, onto the street and into a cab that just about ran over my foot when I opened the door before the driver had stopped; from there, east on Eighty-sixth Street, left on the F.D.R. Drive, and across the bridge.

My grandfather had a ticket waiting, and I took the last flight of the night from LaGuardia to Miami. My mother lived in a new two-story duplex, cheap construction on a canal. The yard was bare, the front door was open, and light shone out. In “The Afterlife”, I describe bottles on their sides in the doorway and on the carpet in the living room, empty bottles. I describe my mother standing on the stairs. In my memory, she wears a long nightgown. Her ankles and feet are blue, and blue-veined. The doctors had told her that she would die if she drank. I suspect that that night, after a long binge, she came close. She was forty-five, fifteen years younger than I am as I write this. I sat with her through her delirium tremens, and held her hand, or kept my hand on her arm, while she shook. She’d been drinking and quitting, and in and out of hospitals and A.A. for two years. My grandfather and I had taken turns watching over her, going to her, through that time. He and I were in contact. He wanted to know if I thought that she would be all right. He knew that she hadn’t ever been. That night in Miami, in my mother’s duplex, after she’d fallen asleep, I cleared the bottles and cleaned the floors and fed the cats. A few days later, once she’d eaten and rested and slept, I drove her to A.A., to what people in recovery call the rooms, rooms in churches and community centers and sometimes schools, where she had friends waiting, friends she had met before and friends she was about to meet; and a sponsor. And, once again, she embarked on sobriety, which lasted, this time, for the rest of her life.

I was born in Sarasota, Florida, on a September night in 1958. In the story that my mother tells of my birth, I was taken from her by force. Her mother, my grandmother, pulled me out of my mother’s arms and kept me. My mother was not allowed to hold me. My father, who had graduated from college the summer before on an R.O.T.C. scholarship, was away, training to command tanks at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where, eleven months later, my sister, Terry, would be born. My mother told me that she and I were distraught; I cried and cried, but her mother would not give me back. There was panic, she told me, and more fighting and crying, and it took my father a day and a night to get there.

Where was my grandfather? I knew my mother’s father as a docile, suffering man. When I was very little, he’d fallen off the roof of the house, while replacing tiles, and broken his back. I remember that house. It was a two-story white stucco bungalow with a red tiled roof, Venetian blinds, a mowed lawn, a paved driveway and carport, a front door that wasn’t used, a guest bedroom downstairs, and three bedrooms upstairs. My sister and I lived with our grandparents when our parents were divorcing for the first time. They would remarry a few years later, when Terry was seven and I was eight, and then divorce again when we were in our early twenties. But, at the time that I am writing about, Terry was five and I was six. I remember lying awake in the heat. Fans blew. Downstairs, a sunporch with orchids and potted shrubs faced a little square yard planted with orange and tangerine trees. There was wisteria and hibiscus. The air was wet and sticky. Down a little walkway out back was the two-story garage where my grandfather spent part of each day, where he had tools hung on a pegboard, stacked paint cans, a worktable with a vise, and beer in an old refrigerator. The garage smelled of paint thinner, insecticide, and lawnmower fuel. My grandfather sat at a bench and mended kitchen-cabinet drawers, or rewired appliances, or sanded wood, while sipping from a can. He chewed cinnamon gum and toothpicks.

In “The Afterlife”, I report that my mother was subjected to Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form of abuse that is carried out, usually by a parent or a caregiver, as unnecessary medical or surgical intervention. My mother recounted a succession of operations, demanded by her mother and performed by compliant doctors. In one story she told, she was a teen-ager, at Sarasota Memorial Hospital. Under anesthesia on the operating table, her chest cut open, she heard the doctors pronounce her dead. She could not move or speak, but she could see them peering down at her. The long story of forced visits to doctors, of my grandmother’s control of her daughter’s body, the authoritarian cycle of manipulation, intimate violation, and symbolic repair, was never understood in my family, and it implicates my grandmother and grandfather, together in collusion or complicity, in crimes against their only child. “They drank,” my mother told me shortly before she died. She told me that they fought and were violent, and that her mother had tried to drown her in a well when she was tiny.

I was in my socks on the fire escape. I was cold, underweight, and scratched up from the roof’s rough surface, from crawling to the edge and leaning over to peer down. I imagined my body on the ground. It was something that I could picture. But the fall, how long would that last? My motor control was failing. I clutched the railing, then let go a little, then grabbed hold, then let go again, but caught myself.

I was not on the roof to jump. I was not there to kill myself. I was there to die, but dying was not a plan. I was not making decisions, choices, threats, or mistakes. I was, I think—looking back now—in acceptance. It was a relinquishing, though at the time I would not have been able to articulate it. I did not want to die, only felt that I would, or should, or must, and I had my pain and my reasons. If you have had this illness, then you’ve had your reasons; and maybe you’ve believed, or still believe, as I have, that it would be better for others, for all the people who have made the mistake of loving you, or who one day might, if you were gone.

Depression, hysteria, melancholia, nervousness, neurosis, neurasthenia, madness, lunacy, insanity, delirium, derangement, demonic possession, black humors, black bile, yellow bile, the black dog, the blues, the blue devils, a brown study, the vapors, a funk, a storm, the abyss, an inferno, Hell, a pain syndrome, stress, an anxiety disorder, lack of affect, an affective disorder, a mood disorder, panic, loneliness, bad wiring, a screw loose, a mercurial temperament, irritability, schizophrenia, unipolar disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit disorder, borderline personality disorder, laziness, pain, rumination, grief, mourning, malingering, unhappiness, hopelessness, sadness, low spirits, invalidism, despondency, dysthymia, detachment, disassociation, dementia praecox, neuralgia, fibromyalgia, oversensitivity, hypersensitivity, idiocy, an unsound mind, cowardice, obstinacy, apathy, recalcitrance, spleen, a broken heart, battle fatigue, shell shock, self-pity, self-indulgence, self-centeredness, weakness, withdrawal, distraction, distemper, a turn in the barrel, a break in a life narrative, bad thoughts, bad feelings, coming undone, coming apart, falling apart, falling to pieces, willfulness, defiance, thoughts of hurting oneself or others, the thousand-yard stare, craziness, rage, misery, mania, morbidity, genius, suicidality, suicidal ideation, aggression, regression, decompensation, drama, breakdown, crackup, catatonia, losing one’s mind, losing one’s shit, losing one’s way, wasting away, psychic disorganization, spiritual despair, shame, raving, the furies, a disease, an enigma, a tragedy, a curse, a sin, and, of course, psychosis—suicide, in the past and in our time, has been called many things. Whatever terms we use, whatever the specific nature of their origins and progress, our so-called mental illnesses are themselves traumatic and stigmatizing. They isolate us from others.

I was thin and cold. I held my arms to my sides. I peered up at the clouds and the jet planes and the sunset. It was hard to look at the sky. I couldn’t hold my head up. I was taking Klonopin for anxiety and insomnia. My mother was dead, and my socks had holes. The light hurt my eyes, and sounds felt like sharp little jabs at my head; when the helicopter came, that afternoon on the roof, I hunched over, protectively. Was the helicopter coming for me? Regan had raised her voice with me. It was happening more and more.

She and I were in the living room. It was a bright April Friday. She’d rushed to Brooklyn from her office in Manhattan, panicked after hearing my voice on the phone, and of course Janice and Nicky were on their way in Janice’s car, in traffic. For months, Regan had been with me, sleep-deprived, anxious, angry, afraid, untouched, breathing my cigarette smoke, not eating, not laughing, morose—the winter. Then, in early spring, I had staggered into Manhattan and spent the night with a former girlfriend. I remember Regan screaming at me that I would go to Hell, and that she hoped I would die.

I wrote so many letters. Most suicides don’t; we don’t leave last testaments. I wrote them all winter long, on a notepad, while sitting on a tarp on the living-room floor. Writing, moving my arm, my wrist, my hand, was effortful. My grip on the pen was rigid, and my hands ached, and were always cold. I wrote an opening, ripped the page from the pad, and began another note. The notes were apologies. Sometimes I called friends and held them on the phone. I was fine, I told them. When I lay down, I crossed my arms over my chest, in the position of a corpse.

But then I was up, startled, pacing, shaking, scared, awake without having slept, worrying about my heart, spreading out the tarp, not wanting to leave a mess, and then sitting with pills, pad, pen, and a knife, an old Sabatier that had been in our kitchen when I was a boy. The blade was rusty. None of the letters got finished. At the end of the day, at around five or five-thirty, before Regan came over after work—she was a poet but worked then as an administrator at a hedge fund—I stored the tarp, replaced the knife in the kitchen drawer, cleaned the ashtrays, put away the pills, and buried the suicide notes deep in the garbage.

On the roof, late that day in April, after running from the apartment and up the stairs, after a session of hanging from the fire escape and letting go in stages, I climbed the ladder to the roof and huddled against the stairwell bulkhead, next to the door to the stairs. I was breathing fast, and my body hurt. Beyond the Brooklyn rooftops was Manhattan. Lights were on in the skyscrapers. The pain seemed to come from my skin and my muscles and my joints and my bones. But when I touched myself I couldn’t find anything. I felt as if I hurt everywhere, but also nowhere. My chest was constricted, as if a weight were pressing in—but from where? There was no weight, no feeling of a source or origin or cause, nothing to palpate. I’d say that it was the pain of being crushed or squeezed to death, but I’ve never been crushed or squeezed to death. Have you? Have you felt as if your body were collapsing from the inside, collapsing and hardening? Where was Regan? Where were my friends? I wanted a bullet. I’d wanted one since Christmas, to eliminate an itch behind my temple. I remember lying in bed, imagining the bullet easing in. Was Jesus waiting, or a trip into brightness, some stellar afterlife, like the one my mother had imagined on her deathbed? Was death knowledge, or nothing, or might I wake up, a baby again, born into some new violence? What were the chances? Might I, after falling, be maimed and alive? If I was gone, would Regan live?

**无处不在：一场自杀旅程**

 

*我那时不想死，是觉得我不能，不应该，不可以死，而我也有我的痛苦与理由。*

——唐纳德•安德里姆

 

*我没有从楼顶跳下来。我没有以这种方式自杀。我准备去死，但死亡无计划可言。我不是在决定，选择，威胁，或是犯错。如今回望，我觉得那时的我是在接受。*

 

2006年4月的一个周五，从下午到晚上，我都在我布鲁克林的公寓屋顶上踱步，我爬下逃生梯，扶着扶手，然后又忍着疼痛爬回去，躺在屋顶，或蜷缩着，或伸展四肢平躺着，或趴着，偷偷地从窗台望出去，凝视着远处。屋顶被漆成了银色。这栋建筑有四层楼。那天整个早上，我都在疯狂地拨着电话，一个接着一个，和我所有的朋友们通话。贾尼斯有车，她和尼克正从曼哈顿跨桥过来，但那儿正堵车，没人知道我在哪儿。

从屋顶看下去，整个世界都像是在尖叫。我听见警车，救护车，还有消防车发出的警铃声。会有什么紧急情况发生在我身上呢？一架直升机正从我头顶上空飞过，又再次盘旋回来。我刚逃离的那个女人，那个赶在别人前面下班的女人，那个和我住在楼下公寓的女人，雷根，以为我跑到街上去了。我们因为我做的一些事情而吵了一架。我一定伤害到了她，但我俩都非常痛苦。她说的话很刺耳，所以我跑开了，想要去死，让她得到解脱。

正值日落，新泽西的整片天空被染成橘红，我穿着袜子，不停颤抖。我很害怕，不是焦虑，也不是受到惊吓，而是因我的人生而感到害怕。我不知道为什么我必须要从屋顶跳下去，我不知道为什么跳下去的一定要是我。

或者说，我知道。我正患着精神方面的疾病，一种严重的急性病，而我也清楚地知道自杀意味着什么。我知道我想要去死。每时每刻，我都感到我正在死去。

在讲述与我病情相关的故事时，我尽量不谈及抑郁。抑郁如同沟壑，如同山谷，如同急转直下的坡，如同回归生命的起点。而在我的经验里，自杀却不是这样的。我坚信自杀只是再自然不过的事情，是一场疾病的必然历程，不是突发行动，无从选择，不能随意决策，也不是愿望达成。我无法理解，为何要把自杀看作是对苦痛的回应，或是对生的启示。自杀不是行为，不是死亡，也不是从高空坠落，亦或是诱因使然。在我眼里，自杀是一场漫长的疾病，是源于心灵创伤与孤独的疾病，是源于感知的丧失，源于暴力与忽视，源于失去家庭与归属感的疾病。如果你一定要区分清楚，那自杀就是身体与心灵共同患病，随着时间推移，而致你于死地的疾病。数年来，我不断试图自杀，徘徊在死亡的边缘，尽管在这期间，我几次入院治疗，经历了五十多次电休克疗法——过去叫做“冲击疗法”，痊愈，复发，又痊愈，如此往复。这些记忆仿佛近在咫尺，但有时又觉得是发生在遥远的过去，恍如隔世，像是往生，像是他生，又像是我自己的人生。

我正吊在逃生梯上。脚尖还能勉强踩住。太阳渐渐下沉；天气变凉了。我穿着袜子，但没穿鞋，我的手掌摩伤了，开始起水泡，我稍稍把手松开了点儿，一次一只手。手掌侧滑了一下，我迅速伸手紧紧抓住了围栏。我向下凝视着水泥的露台，和环绕后院的铁丝网围栏。那片后院无法进入，又小又不起眼。我的公寓在三楼，如果你从厨房和卧室的窗子探出头，就能够看见后院。但我从来没有认真看过那里。

我的下方，是那个不大的露台，上面堆满了垃圾，楼梯井通向锁住的地下室和锅炉房。除此之外就是坚硬的地面。2006年时，有一户新来的人家搬进了一楼的公寓，他们把铁丝网围栏换成了木制围栏，还在院子里放了烧烤架和野餐桌；无论是天气暖和的日子，或是在寒冷的冬季，我总能在平日里，听见他们的孩子和年纪稍大的孩子们，还有邻居的那些孩子一起，在这条街上不远处的私立学校屋顶操场上，玩耍与尖叫的声音。

课间休息结束了；放学了；夜幕降临了。我没有小孩。我抓着栏杆。看着地面时的眩晕感要比望着天空时要弱一些。天上云聚云散。我能看见三三两两的人正在旁边楼上的私人露台喝鸡尾酒，享受工作之余的闲暇时间，这意味着春日周末的开始。此刻，我回忆起那天，想到，或许那些人们会好奇为什么那个从逃生梯爬到屋顶的男人，又要爬回逃生梯，仅靠一只手支撑着吊在那儿。他们会认为他正在工作吗？正在做什么修缮工作，或是他们不熟悉的其他工作？如果他们知道了他的困境，他们会理解他就要去死吗？又或者，他们会觉得他正在求生？

天色越来越暗，我能听见街上来来往往的汽车声，现在正是人们下班后开车途经布鲁克林回家的时间。我很冷；我吊在这儿有一段时间了。但不知道已经有五个小时了。无论过去多长时间都是有可能的。我穿着长裤，衬衫，还有袜子。因为爬上屋顶，我的手和衣服都弄脏了。我还记得我的裤子穿着很宽松，也记得我在冬天里瘦了许多。我的皮带去哪儿了？我把手塞进口袋里，双臂紧紧地贴在身体两侧，攥紧了裤子，试图让自己暖和一点儿。

我曾写过我母亲的故事，关于她酗酒的一生，关于她在死亡面前的退缩，以及关于我之于她的，儿子，救世主和遗弃者这三个角色。在她去世那年，我开始写作，太快地投入写作，让我伤痕累累。那本书叫《来生》，内容分成了七部分，在古代神话和文学作品中，母亲刚去世后的那段时间被称作服丧期，而正是在那段时间里，我完成了作品的手稿。书中讲述了我家人的死亡。写这本书时，我很兴奋，但选择公开发表，却是一种折磨。我不知道这本书其实不是写我自己的，而是写作者和读者间共有的某种东西。这是一场从平面文字到立体场景，从反抗到接受，从屈辱到爱的变换过程。但那些属于我的过去的世界——佛罗里达，弗吉尼亚，那些我儿时的故地——在书中进行了重塑，付出了巨大的代价。我深陷于背叛之中：我母亲对我的背叛，我对我母亲的背叛，和我对自己的背叛。

二十岁出头时，我刚刚踏出校园，搬到纽约，住在东八十五街，我一次次地回到迈阿密，去拯救我的母亲。我的父亲早已离她而去，并迅速组建了新的家庭，而她却整日酗酒，喝的烂醉如泥。

时间倒流，回到纽约。一天夜里，我正和朋友们在麦迪逊酒吧里，这家酒吧位于麦迪逊大道，建于上世纪七十年代，就在老惠特尼博物馆附近。墙壁因为文人们刻上去的签名而伤痕累累，其中沃尔特•温切尔的签名最为显眼。我正喝着一杯曼哈顿鸡尾酒。酒吧后面有一部公用电话，我把酒放在桌上，去给我母亲打了一通电话，听着电话听筒里的铃声响了十五次，二十次，二十五次。有声音从那头传来，接通了，但没人说话。“妈妈，妈妈，妈妈，”我开口，之后挂掉了电话，转而打给了住在北卡罗莱纳的我的外公。外公总是很担心他的女儿。我告诉外公，我母亲有麻烦了，我得去佛罗里达。我回到吧台，告诉朋友们我得走了，然后回到公寓，收拾行李，检查火炉，断掉电源，锁好门，继而飞奔下楼，司机还没停好车，我就拉开门钻了进去。汽车一路往东，驶上八十五大街，再左转，开上富兰克林•罗斯福大道，最后驶过大桥。

外公还拿着票在等，我赶上了最近一班从拉瓜迪亚机场到迈阿密的飞机。母亲住在一栋坐落在运河旁的廉价二层楼里。院子里光秃秃的，前门没关，灯光从那儿倾泻出来。我在《来生》一书中写道，门边和客厅的地毯上到处都是倒落在地的酒瓶，全已空空如也。我描述道，母亲那时正站在楼梯上。在我的记忆里，她穿着长款睡衣。她的脚踝还有双脚发青，青筋突起。医生已经告诉过她，如果继续喝酒的话她会死的。我怀疑，那晚的放纵差点就让医生的话成真了。她那时45岁，比此刻正在写这篇文章的我还要年轻15岁。在她震颤性谵妄症发作时，我陪在她身旁，当她颤抖时，我抓着她的手，或是手臂。两年间，她饮酒又戒酒，在医院与戒酒互助会之间进进出出。那段时间，我和外公轮流照护她。我们一直保持联系。他想知道我是不是觉得她会好起来。但他知道不会。一天晚上，在迈阿密，我母亲的住所里，待她入睡后，我清理了那些酒瓶，打扫了卫生，又喂了猫。几天后，等她吃过饭，休息了一会儿，然后睡了一觉之后，我就载着她去了戒酒互助会，去了那些正在康复中的人们所称的房间，这些房间设于教堂内，社区中心，或是学校里。在那里，有等待着她的朋友们，有她认识的，还有她将要认识的；那里还有互助会的发起人。她再一次开始戒酒，这一次，她坚持了下来。

1958年9月的一天夜里，我在佛罗里达州的萨拉索塔出生。我妈妈告诉我，在我出生那天，我被强制带离了她的身边。她的妈妈，也就是我的外婆，将我从我母亲的怀里夺去自己带。她不允许母亲抱我。而我的父亲，自从去年夏天在后备军官训练团拿到了奖学金之后，就离开去往北卡罗来纳州的布拉格堡，参加指挥坦克的培训。而11个月之后，我的妹妹特里就是在那里出生的。母亲说，当时，她和我都很烦躁；我不停地哭闹，但她的妈妈不肯把我送还给母亲。她告诉我那儿乱作一团，充斥着争吵和哭闹，而我的父亲花了一天一夜的时间才赶到。

我的外公在哪儿呢？我知道外公是个温顺的人，也是个饱受病痛折磨的人。我还很小的时候，他在换瓦片时，从屋顶摔了下来，导致背部骨折。我记得那幢房子。是一幢拥有红瓦屋顶的，双层灰泥小屋。装饰着软百叶窗，有精心修剪过的草坪，有铺好的车道，有车库，前门废弃了，楼下有一间客房，楼上有三间卧室。在我们父母第一次闹离婚的那段时间里，我和我妹妹与我们的祖父母一起住在那儿。他们在几年后又复合了，那时特里七岁，我八岁，随后在我们二十多岁时，他们再一次离婚。但我要讲的，是特里五岁，我六岁时的事情。我记得当时天气炎热，我躺着，睡不着。风扇开着。楼下有一间日光室，里面放满了兰花还有盆栽灌木植物，面朝种着柑桔树和橘子树的一小块地。那儿有紫藤和木槿花。空气潮湿又黏腻。再顺着走道下行，外面是两层楼高的车库，我的外公每天都会在那儿待一会儿，那里的钉板上挂着他的很多工具，堆着一些油漆罐，还有老虎钳，以及一台装着啤酒的旧冰箱。车库里充斥着油漆稀释剂，杀虫剂还有割草机燃料的味道。我的外公会坐在长条工作台上，一边啜着罐头，一边修理厨柜的抽屉，或是给一些装置更换电线，又或者用砂纸打磨木头。他嚼着肉桂口香糖，还会叼着根牙签。

   在《来生》中，我写道，我的母亲深受代理型孟乔森综合症的折磨，这种病症表现为滥用不必要的药物治疗和外科手术治疗，实施者往往是父母或监护人。我的母亲提到她做过一系列手术，都是她妈妈要求的，而那些顺从的医生居然听之任之。其中一次她讲的，是她还是个少女时，在萨拉索塔纪念医院的故事。她被麻醉了，躺在手术台上，她的胸膛被切开，她听见医生宣告她死了。她不能动，也没办法说话，但却能看见那些医生正俯视着她。这个有关被迫看病，有关外婆对女儿身体的控制，有关独裁式的操纵，有关隐私的侵犯，有关象征性的治愈的长长的故事从未被我的家人们读懂过。这个故事还暗中说明，我的外婆和外公串通并共谋了这场对他们唯一孩子的犯罪。母亲在她临死前曾告诉我，“他们是酒鬼”。她说他们会打人，很暴力。在她还是婴儿时，她妈妈曾试图把她扔到井里淹死。

我穿着袜子，站在逃生梯上。浑身发冷，轻飘飘的，贴着粗糙的屋顶，爬到边缘，俯身向下看。我想象我的身体躺在地上。我可以在脑海中勾勒出这个场景。但是下坠会耗费多长的时间？我的“发动机”失控了。我抓紧栏杆，接着稍稍松开一点，接着再抓紧，再松开，但最终我挽救了自己。

我没有从楼顶跳下来。我没有以这种方式自杀。我准备去死，但死亡无计划可言。我不是在决定，选择，威胁，或是犯错。如今回望，我觉得那时的我是在接受。那是一种放手，尽管那时我还不清楚它到底是什么。我那时不想死，是觉得我不能，不应该，不可以死，而我也有我的痛苦与理由。如果你与我同病相怜，那你一定也有你的理由；而你也可能与我一样，曾经坚信，甚至现在也坚信着，就算你离开了，那些错误地爱着你的，或是未来会犯下这错误的人们，也不会感到痛苦。

过去，在我们的意识中，自杀意味着许多东西——沮丧，歇斯底里，忧郁症，神经质，神经症，神经衰弱症，疯狂，精神失常，疯癫，谵妄，精神错乱，恶魔附身，黑色体液，黑色胆汁，黄色胆汁，情绪低落，抑郁，阵发性抑郁，空想，蒸汽，沮丧，风暴，深渊，火海，地狱，疼痛综合症，压力，焦虑症，感觉缺乏，情绪障碍，恐慌，孤独，搭错线，缺筋少弦，善变，烦躁，精神分裂症，单相情感障碍，双相情感障碍，创伤后应激障碍，强迫型精神障碍，注意力缺乏，边缘型人格障碍，怠惰，痛苦，迷思，悲痛，哀痛，伪装疾病，悲伤，忧伤，情绪低落，病弱，意志消沉，精神抑郁，超然，分裂，早发性痴呆，神经痛，纤维性肌痛，过度敏感，极度敏感，愚蠢，头脑不清，怯懦，固执，冷漠，顽抗，脾性，心碎，战争疲劳症，炮弹休克症，自怜，自我放纵，自我中心，软弱，退缩，分心，头脑发热，极度受限，日常生活中断，负面想法，负面感情，失态，失措，失常，失控，蔑视，自残或伤人，茫然，发狂，狂怒，不幸，躁狂，病态，天才，自杀倾向，自杀观念，攻击性，退化，心理失调，大惊小怪，崩溃，坠落，紧张症，失智，失禁，迷失，日益消瘦，精神混乱，精神绝望，羞耻，胡言乱语，暴怒，是病，是难解之谜，是一出悲剧，是诅咒，是罪孽，当然也是一种精神病。无论我们用什么称谓，无论它们的起源与发展中有什么特殊性质，我们所说的这些精神疾病，都是他们的创伤与烙印。它们让我们与他人隔绝开来。

我很虚弱，又觉得冷。双臂紧贴身体两侧。我抬起头，出神地看着天上的云，飞机，还有晚霞。抬头看天是件难事。我没办法一直仰着头。因为焦虑和失眠，我一直在服用氯硝西泮。我的母亲去世了，我的袜子破了洞。光线太刺眼，尖锐的噪音在我脑子里横冲直撞；那天下午直升机来时，我在屋顶，弓着身体以保护自己。那架直升机是因为我来的吗？雷根大声地朝我说话。已是发生过太多次的场景。

我和雷根待在客厅里。那是个晴朗的四月周五。在接到我的电话后，她像疯了一样，从在曼哈顿的办公室飞奔至布鲁克林，而贾尼斯和尼克，那时当然正堵在路上。那时是冬季，雷根陪了我数个月，睡不好觉，焦虑，生气，恐惧，被我拒于千里之外，忍受我抽烟，不吃饭，不能放声大笑，情绪低落。之后，春天来临时，我去了曼哈顿，和我一位前任女友共度夜晚。我记得雷根朝我尖叫，说我会下地狱的，说希望我去死。

我写了很多信。大多数自杀的人不会写这么多信，不会留下遗言。我整个冬天都在写信，坐在客厅地板铺的防水布上，用笔记本写。我的手臂、手腕、手，因为写作而努力动起来。我的握笔姿势很僵硬，手很痛，总是觉得冷。写下开头，撕掉，再次重写。都是些道歉的话语。有时我打电话给朋友，在电话里和他们聊天。我告诉他们我很好。当我躺着时，会把双臂交叉放在胸前，就像尸体那样。

但之后我站起身，惊慌失措，来回跺步，颤抖着，恐惧着，我一秒也没睡着，担心着我的心脏，我不想搞得一团乱，于是把防水布铺开，坐下来，旁边放着药，本子，笔，还有一把刀，刀是塞巴迪牌的，在我小时候这把刀就一直放在厨房里。刀刃已经生锈了。我连一封信都没写完。那天傍晚，大约五点或者五点三十分左右，我赶在雷根下班回来之前——雷根是一名诗人，但那时她在一家对冲基金公司当主管——把防水布收好，将刀放回厨房的抽屉里，清理了烟灰缸，把药片放回原处，然后把那些自杀信息埋进了垃圾堆里。

在那之后的四月某一天，从公寓逃出来后，我爬上了楼，在逃生梯不停地纠结于抓牢吊紧还是松手放弃，几番挣扎之后，我沿着梯子爬到屋顶，蜷缩在楼梯防火门旁的楼梯井隔板处。呼吸急促，浑身疼痛。从布鲁克林区的重重屋顶望出去，可以看到曼哈顿。摩天大楼灯火通明。痛感如同从我的肌肤与筋骨发散出来。可当我触碰自己时，又什么都感觉不到。像是遍体鳞伤，却又完好无损。我的胸腔急剧收缩，如同被某个重物压迫着，但这压力从何而来？没有物体，感觉不到压力源自何处，因何而起，无可触及。我想说：这痛感源于生命不可承受之重，可我从未承受过这样的重量。你呢？你曾感受过这种重压吗？这种仿佛从体内开始崩塌的感受，这种破碎与淬炼的感受。雷根在哪儿？我的朋友们在哪儿？我想要一颗子弹。从圣诞那天我就这样想了，想靠它来消除我太阳穴深处的难耐。我还记得，我躺在床上，想象着子弹从太阳穴穿入的感觉。耶稣在等我吗？还是这本就是去往光明以及崭新来生的旅程？就如我母亲临死前幻想的那样？死亡是一种觉知吗？又或什么也不是？当我醒来时，会重生吗？作为婴儿诞生，再次开始新的争斗？这些机会都是什么？我坠楼后，会残废吗？还是继续活着？如果我死了，雷根会活着吗？
